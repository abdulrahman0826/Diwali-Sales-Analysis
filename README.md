Diwali Sales Analysis by using Python libraries ./Project/
**ðŸ“Š Diwali Sales Data Analysis**
**Project Goal**
The primary objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Diwali Sales dataset to identify key customer demographics, popular product categories, and purchasing trends. 
The insights derived are crucial for optimizing marketing strategies, inventory management, and maximizing sales during future festival seasons.

**Methodology**
The analysis was conducted using Python and the following key libraries:
**Pandas**: For data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.
**NumPy**: For numerical operations.
**Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization and generating insightful plots (bar charts, count plots) to understand distributions and trends.
**Key Data Preparation Steps:**
Loaded the CSV data using unicode_escape encoding.
Cleaned the dataset by dropping irrelevant columns (Status, unnamed1) and handling missing values (dropna()).
Converted the Amount column to the integer data type for accurate aggregation.

ðŸ“ˆ **Key Findings and Business Insights**
The analysis identified clear patterns in purchasing behavior across demographics, location, and product preference.
** Sales Analysis**(Sales by Category)
The sales analysis clearly indicates a concentration of spending in specific categories.
Insight Detail
**Top Categories**
Food, Clothing, and Electronics are the most popular product categories by sales amount. This suggests high consumer interest in items relevant to festive celebrations, gifting, and personal use.
Strategic Focus
Inventory and promotional efforts should be heavily focused on these top categories to maximize returns.
**2. Demographic Insights**
The highest spending is concentrated among a specific customer segment:

**Age Group**
The 26-35 years age group shows the highest expenditure.
**Occupation**
Customers working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation occupations are the largest contributors to sales.
**Top Products**
Analysis of Product_ID reveals the top 10 best-selling individual items, guiding inventory stocking decisions.
**3. Geographical Insights**
